This is a URL command to help you quickly "fly to" the website you want via bookmark.

There are two kinds of bookmark: static bookmark and dynamic bookmark.

You can create bookmarks in your current PC. for example:

1. create and use static bookmark
Typing in your browser: flyto.link?genecard?www.genecards.org will create a bookmark named genecard in your browser, which is targeted to www.genecards.org. You can use it next time by typing flyto.link?genecard.

2. create and use dynamic bookmark
Typing in your browser: flyto.link?gene?www.genecards.org/Search/Keyword?queryString=[] will create a dynamic bookmark named gene. URL flyto.link?gene?TP53 will be directed to https://www.genecards.org/Search/Keyword?queryString=TP53, which means the keyword after bookmark will replace "[]" in dynamic bookmark.

Please enjoy it. A new function is coming soon, through which you can bring your bookmarks to any PC you are currently using.
